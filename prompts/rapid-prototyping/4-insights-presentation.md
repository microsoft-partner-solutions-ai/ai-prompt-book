## Insights Presentation
Prompts to extract learnings, summarize results, and define next steps from sprints into a customer presentation deck.

### Recommended Model: 
gpt-5

### System Message:
```text
You are a senior solution architect and product strategist helping to summarize and communicate the outcomes of a proof-of-concept rapid prototype developed for a customer.

You will be given context and artifacts from a completed prototype (e.g., use case, data sources, architecture, code, results). Your task is to extract key insights, assess feasibility, and generate structured content suitable for inclusion in a presentation deck.

Focus areas:
- Prototype overview and objectives
- Summary of technical implementation and architecture
- Key design decisions and rationale
- Outcomes and feasibility assessment
- Lessons learned and technical insights
- Recommendations and next steps

Guidelines:
1. Analyze the inputs and determine which aspects of the prototype were most significant, technically interesting, or impactful.
2. Highlight insights that influenced the feasibility of the solution, including integration considerations, performance, and accuracy.
3. Identify reusable patterns, technical blockers, or innovations from the engagement.
4. Structure your output in a format that is easy to copy into a PowerPoint deck. Include slide titles and bullet points for each slide.
5. Be concise, practical, and audience-aware — assume the deck will be presented to a mix of technical leaders and decision-makers.

### User Prompt Template:
```text

## Engagement Summary
{{Brief summary of the partner prototype engagement.
e.g., "We helped a global financial firm prototype an AI-powered misconduct investigation tool that integrates customer APIs, Azure OpenAI, and Semantic Kernel."}}

## Use Case and Objective
{{What the prototype was intended to demonstrate or validate?
e.g., "Rapid detection of fraud, harassment, or workplace threats using LLM agents on historical email data."}}

## Technologies and Tools Used
{{List of technologies used in the prototype.
e.g., Azure OpenAI, Semantic Kernel, Python, LangChain, OpenSearch, etc.}}

## Data Source(s)
{{Describe the type and source of data used.
e.g., Email archive indexed in OpenSearch and accessed via REST API.}}

## Architecture / Implementation Summary
{{Brief technical overview of how the solution was built.
e.g., Agent was built using Semantic Kernel planner; Email data fetched via authenticated API calls and passed to Azure OpenAI for classification and summarization.}}

## Results / Observations
{{Describe key outcomes from the prototype.
e.g., "Agent correctly flagged 90% of harassment-related emails; low latency; OpenAI summarization highly relevant."}}

## Challenges or Constraints
{{Any issues encountered — performance, security, API limits, alignment problems, etc.}}

## Next Steps / Recommendations
{{What should the partner do next? What would make the solution production-ready?
e.g., Productionize orchestration, add human-in-the-loop review, scale with larger datasets.}}

## Audience
{{Primary audience for the deck.
e.g., Partner CTO, product team, compliance analysts.}}

## Goal
Generate slide titles and concise bullet points for each slide to include in a PowerPoint deck that summarizes the prototype engagement, technical feasibility, and recommended next steps. Make it easy for a solution architect or partner lead to copy and paste into a slide template.

## Example Usage:
```text

## Engagement Summary
We partnered with a national grocery chain to prototype an AI-powered demand forecasting assistant. The goal was to enable category managers to ask natural language questions about historical sales trends and receive predictive insights to support weekly planning.

## Use Case and Objective
The prototype aimed to validate whether a generative AI agent could:
- Ingest historical sales data
- Generate time-series forecasts for specific SKUs, categories, or stores
- Allow users to ask questions like “What’s the projected demand for strawberries in New York next week?” and receive chart + text answers

## Technologies and Tools Used
- Azure OpenAI (GPT-4.1)
- Semantic Kernel (planner + custom forecast plugin)
- Azure Blob Storage (for sales CSV ingestion)
- Azure ML (for time-series forecasting)

## Data Source(s)
- 18 months of daily sales data (SKU-level) hosted in Azure Blob Storage
- Additional context (holidays, promotions) provided via CSV metadata files

## Architecture / Implementation Summary
- Data ingestion handled via a Blob-to-DataFrame pipeline
- Forecasting model developed with Azure ML encapsulated in a Python plugin 
- Semantic Kernel used to route user prompts to either the plugin or GPT model
- Console app allowed natural language Q&A over a forecasted data layer

## Results / Observations
- Agent responded accurately to >80% of natural language forecast questions
- Multi-turn clarification (e.g., “which location?”) handled well via planner
- Prototype latency under 5s for most interactions

## Challenges or Constraints
- Natural language mapping to SKUs required normalization (e.g., “soda” vs “carbonated beverage”)
- ML model struggled with cold-start SKUs

## Next Steps / Recommendations
- Integrate real-time inventory data from SAP
- Add SKU synonym dictionary and embedding search
- Migrate from console app to Azure Web App with Teams tab integration
- Include guardrails for uncertain predictions (e.g., low-confidence intervals)

## Audience
- Partner product and AI leads, retail analytics team

## Goal
- Generate slide titles and concise bullet points for each slide to include in a PowerPoint deck that summarizes the prototype engagement, technical feasibility, and recommended next steps.
Make it easy for a solution architect to copy and paste into a slide template.
