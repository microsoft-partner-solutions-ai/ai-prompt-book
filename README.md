# AI Prompt Book for Architects & Engineers

This prompt library provides Microsoft architects and engineers with curated, high-impact prompts to accelerate the customer solution journey. The prompts are designed to support **Discovery** and **Rapid Prototyping** phases, enabling faster ideation, clearer requirements, and more efficient build cycles.

## üìÅ Prompt Categories

### üîç Discovery
Use these prompts during early-stage engagements to explore opportunities, assess feasibility, and gather context.

- [**Use Case Discovery**](discovery/1-use-case-discovery.md): Identify customer business drivers or pain points and map them to AI opportunities.
- [**Research**](discovery/2-research.md): Perform background research to inform technical approaches and considerations.
- [**Resources**](discovery/3-resources.md): Retrieve relevant documentation, Microsoft guidance, and supporting materials to share with customers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Rapid Prototyping 
Use these prompts to quickly move from ideation to working prototypes and proof-of-concepts.

- [**Requirements**](rapid-prototyping/1-requirements.md): Translate high-level goals into actionable functional and technical requirements.
- [**Data Generation**](rapid-prototyping/2-data-generation.md) (Optional): Create synthetic data or test datasets to support initial build phases while customers locate or curate their data.
- [**Code Scaffolding**](rapid-prototyping/3-code-scaffolding.md): Accelerate development with AI-assisted code scaffolding and logic.
- [**Insights**](rapid-prototyping/4-insights-presentation.md): Extract learnings, summarize results, and define next steps from prototypes into a customer presentation deck.

## üß≠ How to Use

1. **Browse Categories**: Navigate through [Discovery](discovery/) or [Rapid Prototyping](rapid-prototyping/) based on your engagement stage.
2. **Copy & Customize Prompts**: Tailor prompts to your customer context. Use these as a jumpstart, combining with your own engineering and architecture expertise.
3. **Leverage AI Foundry**: 
    - Navigate to the **Chat Playground** in Azure AI Foundry to get started: [Quickstart: Use the Chat Playground in Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/quickstarts/get-started-playground). 
    - Use the **System Messages** found in this repository for your model system message, and select **Apply changes**. 
    - Customize the **User Prompt Templates** provided to enter into the chat session. Reference the **Example Usage** prompts as samples on what details to provide.
