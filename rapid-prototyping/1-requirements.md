## Requirements Definition Prompts

### Recommended Model: 
gpt-4.1

### System Message:
```text
You are a senior solution architect tasked with gathering and structuring solution requirements for a rapid prototyping engagement.

You will be given early-stage inputs about a use case or idea from a customer or stakeholder. Your goal is to help define clear, testable requirements that will guide downstream prototyping work.

Follow these steps:

1. Clarify the problem the solution is intended to solve.
2. Identify who the end users are and what their workflows or questions will look like.
3. Extract functional and technical requirements, including inputs, outputs, and key interactions.
4. Identify constraints or assumptions (e.g., existing systems, preferred technologies, data access).
5. Propose evaluation criteria for what success looks like in the prototype.

Deliverable: Output a well-structured requirements summary, suitable for sharing with a solution architect or engineering team. Use sections with clear labels (e.g., Problem Statement, Users, Functional Requirements, etc.).
```

### User Prompt Template:
```text
## Use Case Description
{{Briefly describe the idea, challenge, or opportunity.
e.g., "We want to use generative AI to streamline our employee onboarding process by automating answers to policy questions and helping new hires complete tasks."}}

## Target Users
{{Who will use the prototype?
e.g., "New employees at a large enterprise, HR support staff."}}

## Expected Inputs
{{What will the system take as input?
e.g., "Natural language questions from employees about policies or processes."}}

## Expected Outputs
{{What should the system return?
e.g., "Helpful answers, links to internal documents, or a checklist of onboarding tasks."}}

## Primary Goals or Pain Points
{{What business or user need is the prototype solving?
e.g., "Reduce HR workload, help new hires get up to speed faster."}}

## Constraints or Assumptions
{{Are there any limitations or technical context to be aware of?
e.g., "Must work with existing SharePoint knowledge base; IT has approved Azure OpenAI."}}

## Success Criteria
{{What would indicate the prototype is successful?
e.g., "Correct answers to top 20 onboarding questions; less than 5s response time; usable in a Teams chatbot."}}

## Anything Already Decided?
{{Mention if any technologies, platforms, or user experiences are already fixed.
e.g., "Must integrate with Teams; HR prefers a simple chat UI."}}

## Goal
Generate a well-structured set of requirements to guide the rapid prototyping of this solution. 
```

## Example Usage:

```text
## Use Case Description
We want to prototype an AI assistant to help with employee onboarding. It should answer common HR and IT questions, help new hires find key documents, and guide them through early setup tasks.

## Target Users
New employees at our company, mostly remote, across multiple departments. Secondary users include HR staff who may want to monitor or refine the assistant's responses.

## Expected Inputs
Natural language questions from new hires (e.g., “How do I enroll in benefits?”, “Where’s the VPN setup guide?”). Also possibly “I need help getting started.”

## Expected Outputs
Short answers, links to relevant documents, suggested next steps (e.g., “Enroll in 401(k)”, “Setup MFA”), or a checklist.

## Primary Goals or Pain Points
New hires often email HR or IT with the same 30–50 questions. Answers are buried in PDFs, SharePoint, or Teams channels. We want to reduce load on HR and improve new hire experience.

## Constraints or Assumptions
- HR policies are in SharePoint, OneDrive, and a few PDFs
- The company already uses Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure OpenAI is approved
- We’d prefer to surface this via Teams chat

## Success Criteria
- Answers top 20 new hire questions accurately using internal content
- Works in a Teams bot or adaptive card interface
- Returns helpful results in under 5 seconds

## Anything Already Decided?
Yes — it must run in Microsoft Teams and leverage Microsoft 365 data (e.g., SharePoint, OneDrive). OpenAI on Azure is the approved LLM provider.

## Goal
Generate a well-structured set of requirements to guide the rapid prototyping of this solution.
