# Prompt Book Engagement Guide

This engagement guide provides a practical, step-by-step guide for architects to engage partners and customers effectively using the AI Prompt Book. 

It is designed as a modular, Lego-block-style guide so you can adapt to each engagementâ€™s needs based on readiness and priorities. 

Add, combine, skip, or reorder steps as needed.

## ðŸ”Ž Discovery Phase

Use these steps and prompts to explore opportunities, assess feasibility, and gather context. Modular steps let you select depending on whether your customer or partner needs ideation, has a use case already, or just needs quick alignment.

---

### Step 1: Engage & Align

Start by understanding where the customer or partner is â€” do they need ideation, a quick alignment session, or already have defined ideas? Choose the right engagement option.

- Meet the customer or partner to understand their goals, pain points, and needs.  
- Determine if they need a deeper ideation workshop, a quick discovery session, or are bringing specific use cases.

- **Options for Engagement:**
  - **Innovation Workshop** â€“ For customers & partners with broad challenges needing big-picture ideation across Apps, Data, Analytics, and AI.
  - **Discovery Cards Workshop** â€“ For customers & partners needing practical AI scenarios to identify or prioritize use cases.
  - **Brief Discovery or Envisioning Session** â€“ For customers & partners ready to discuss ideas or who have already identified use cases.

### Step 2: Identify and Prioritize Use Cases

Generate, refine, and assess use cases using prompts.

- Facilitate discussions to generate or refine potential use case opportunities.  
- Use **[Use Case Ideation Prompts](discovery/1-use-case-ideation.md)** to map business drivers or pain points to concrete use cases.  
- Use **[Use Case Evaluation Prompts](discovery/2-use-case-evaluation.md)** to assess value, feasibility, and alignment with customer & partner goals.

---

### Step 3: Research & Gather Resources

Gather relevant information and resources to strengthen discussions and recommendations.

- Once candidate use cases are identified, gather information to deepen understanding and support feasibility.  
- Use **[Research Prompts](discovery/3-research.md)** to perform background research on technical considerations and approaches for selected use cases.
- Use **[Resources Prompts](discovery/4-resources.md)** to collect relevant documentation, Microsoft guidance, and supporting materials to share with customers & partners

---

## âš¡ Rapid Prototyping Phase

Translate use cases into requirements, generate data, build POCs, and extract insights. Use these steps and prompts to move from selected use cases into working prototypes and proof-of-concepts.

---

### Step 4: Define Requirements

Define actionable requirements from prioritized use cases to guide development.
- Use **[Requirements Prompts](rapid-prototyping/1-requirements.md)** to break high-level goals into clear functional and technical specs.

---

### Step 5: Prepare or Generate Data

Determine data availability and fill gaps as needed.  
- Use **[Data Generation Prompts](rapid-prototyping/2-data-generation.md)** to create synthetic or test data for early development phases.

---

### Step 6: Build Prototypes

Begin development based on defined requirements and available data. 
- Options for building prototypes:
  - Use **[Code Scaffolding Prompts](rapid-prototyping/3a-code-scaffolding.md)** to create code scaffolding for use with GitHub Copilot, enabling rapid implementation.
  - Use **[Code Generation Prompts](rapid-prototyping/3b-code-generation.md)** to generate complete code prototypes ready for testing and iteration.

---

### Step 7: Extract Insights

After developing rapid prototype, synthesize key findings and plan next steps.  
- Use **[Insights Prompts](rapid-prototyping/4-insights-presentation.md)** to summarize learnings, successes, and open questions for customer presentations.
